        JavaScript debugging
        ====================
        You can purchase this online course (which frequently goes on sale) to learn more about
        debugging JavaScript, but we'll teach you most of these techniques in this class
        https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-debugging-crash-course/

        JavaScript Reference
        ====================
        You should be using W3Schools for all your learning on the JavaScript langauge
        https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp

        If you know how to write JavaScript, and you want to get significantly better, 
        I also recommend the following ebook series

                "You don't know JS" by Kyle Simpson

        You can read the six books in the series online for free using the GitHub 1st edition version from 
        https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/1st-ed/README.md

        The first edition of this series of six books is still available in print form on Amazon.ca, 
        but the electronic version of the 1st edition is no longer available to purchase

        The GitHub 2nd edition is on GitHub as well, but all six books are not yet available in the updated 2nd edition format
        https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS

        If you want the ebook 2nd edition version (Kindle) you can purchase the first & secibd book in the series at
        You Don't Know JS Yet: Get Started (second edition)
        https://www.amazon.ca/You-Dont-Know-JS-Yet-ebook/dp/B084BNMN7T
        You Don't Know JS Yet: Scope & Closures (second edition)

Important Information
=====================
We recommend that you do not use the alert() method in JavaScript as a way of
displaying information to the user.  We also don't recommend you use it for debugging
your code.  We'll show you other debugging techniques using the inspector build into the 
web browser to set breakpoints, examine variables, and how to write debugging information
into the web browser console, or to send it to a backend server for tracking bugs/what is happening

CSSTechniques
=============
The CSS in this HTML/CSS combination shows how we can use CSS selectors to
alter the behavior of the web page when users hover over elements on the 
web page.

The JavaScript in the CSSTechniques.htm file also shows the fact that JavaScript
is not strongly typed, and variables can morph between different data types
at runtime.


HTMLDOMWithJavaScript
=====================
In the HTMLDOMWithJavaScript.htm file you'll see that the time clock does not update when the
alert() dialog is open, clearly showing that the alert() method will block all other JavaScript
from running.  

The onload="" attribute is placed on the <body> tag to initiate calling the JavaScript function 
which initially displays the time on the web page. The function then calls itself repeatedly 
every 1 second by using the setTimeout() function

We also show you in the myJSFunctions.js file the proper way to write JavaScript code that 
checks for possible problems, and then handles them instead of letting the code fail with an
error or a bug that is being caused by poor programming methods.


ExampleCalculator
=================
Note the formula for board feet was based upon information from https://www.omnicalculator.com/construction/board-foot#what-is-a-board-foot

This example uses the onchange="" property on <input> tags to call a JavaScript function that then
examines the web page DOM, getting the information typed into the input fields, converts that information
from string to floating point variables, and then uses the floating point variables in a math equation to
calculate the board feet of lumber you purchase.   

The board foot is not metric, and while a metric version of this calculation can be created, it was too
complex for this example, so it is only in imperial units (feet and inches)

These are some functions we had to use to convert the text values typed into the <input> fields formula
strings into numeric data types (float) so that we could use them in the formula
